    <p>Identifying trends in a population's cause of death is imperative in identifying solutions that could maximize the health of the population. This visualization aims to provide insight into the 10 leading causes of death in the United States over the past 18 years. The dataset <i>NCHS &ndash; Leading Causes of Death: United States</i> can be found at <a href="https://data.cdc.gov/NCHS/NCHS-Leading-Causes-of-Death-United-States/bi63-dtpu/data" target="_blank">data.cdc.gov</a>.</p>
    <br>
    <h4>The Data</h4>
    <p>The dataset is provided by the National Center for Health Statistics and presents the age-adjusted death rates for the 10 leading causes of death in the United States. These statistics are based on the underlying causes of death derived from US resident death certificates filed between 1999-2016. Before digging into what the data can tell us, it is first important to understand the dimensions of the data we'll be examining and to identify the 10 leading causes of death.</p>

    <h6>I. Dimensions</h6>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Year:</b> year of death (1999-2016)</li>
      <li><b>Cause Name:</b> underlying cause of death</li>
      <li><b>Age-adjusted Death Rate:</b> death rate adjusted to account for aging population (deaths per 100,000 population)</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>US Leading Causes of Death: 2016</h4>

    <p>By charting the leading causes of death with their age-adjusted death rates for the most recent year, we can identify the critical risks affecting our population today. From the bar chart, we can observe two causes of death whose rates far surpass the others. In 2016, heart disease was the leading cause of death with a death rate of 165.5 per 100,000 population, with cancer following closely behind.</p>

    <h4>Heart Disease - Age-Adjusted Death Rates: 1999-2016</h4>

    <p>With Americans being most at risk from heart disease, we can investigate further to examine how the death rates from heart disease have changed over time. From the line graph, we can see that deaths due to heart disease have been declining each year. The death rates from heart disease have decreased nearly 38%, from their peak in 1999. So, while heart disease is still the most severe condition affecting the population today, can we say itâ€™ll be this way much longer? </p>

    <h4>US Leading Causes of Death: 1999-2016</h4>

    <p>In the last section, we've discovered that a snapshot of data sometimes does not tell the entire story. We've learned that while heart disease is the leading cause of death, it has been visibly declining over time. With heart disease in decline, we might wonder how the rest of these conditions have been faring. Can you spot any more trends?</p>

    <h4>Takeaways</h4>

    <p>In summary, we can see that the leading causes of death have been changing over time. We can identify visible declines in conditions like heart disease and cancer. Additionally, we can proactively spot emerging concerns like the recent uptick in unintentional injuries. The data highlights why continued research in these areas is critical to improving the overall health of the population and where we've seen success so far, in the form of decreasing death rates.</p>

    <p>Finally, it's important for viewers to understand the severity of these condiions. With this information, viewers have the opportunity to adopt healthier habits to combat high-risk, preventable conditions like heart disease and type II diabetes. </p>
