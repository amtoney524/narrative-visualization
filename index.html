    <p>Identifying trends in a population's cause of death is imperative in identifying solutions that could maximize the health of the population. This visualization aims to provide insight into the 10 leading causes of death in the United States over the past 18 years. The dataset <i>NCHS &ndash; Leading Causes of Death: United States</i> can be found at <a href="https://data.cdc.gov/NCHS/NCHS-Leading-Causes-of-Death-United-States/bi63-dtpu/data" target="_blank">data.cdc.gov</a>.</p>
    <br>
    <h4>The Data</h4>
    <p>The dataset is provided by the National Center for Health Statistics and presents the age-adjusted death rates for the 10 leading causes of death in the United States. These statistics are based on the underlying cause of death derived from US resident death certificates filed between 1999-2016. Before digging into what the data can tell us, it is first important to understand the dimensions of the data we'll be examining.</p>

    <h6>I. Dimensions</h6>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Year:</b> year of death (1999-2016)</li>
      <li><b>Cause Name:</b> underlying cause of death</li>
      <li><b>State:</b> state in which the death certificate was filed (includes each of the 50 states, DC, and the entire US)</li>
      <li><b>Age-adjusted Death Rate:</b> death rate adjusted to account for aging population (deaths per 100,000 population)</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>US Leading Causes of Death: 2016</h4>

    <br />

    <h4>Heart Disease Age-Adjusted Death Rate: 1999-2016</h4>

    <p>Now that we know heart disease is our leading cause of death, we want to examine how heart disease has affected Americans over the years. We can see from the data that death rates are decline, from their peak in 1999.</p>
